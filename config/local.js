/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * Use this file to specify configuration settings for use while developing
 * the app on your personal system: for example, this would be a good place
 * to store database or email passwords that apply only to you, and shouldn't
 * be shared with others in your organization.
 *
 * These settings take precedence over all other config files, including those
 * in the env/ subfolder.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *		local.js is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git
 *		as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *		this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *		Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *		machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *		(like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *		of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *    In a production environment, you probably want to leave this file out
 *    entirely and leave all your settings in env/production.js
 *
 *

   * The runtime "environment" of your Sails app is either typically         *
   * 'development' or 'production'.                                          *
   *                                                                         *
   * In development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you       *
   * (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and               *
   * debugging output)                                                       *

   * In production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to        *
   * optimize performance. You should always put your app in production mode *
   * before you deploy it to a server.  This helps ensure that your Sails    *
   * app remains stable, performant, and scalable.                           *
   *                                                                         *
   * By default, Sails sets its environment using the `NODE_ENV` environment *
   * variable.  If NODE_ENV is not set, Sails will run in the                *
   * 'development' environment.                                              *
